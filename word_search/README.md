Word search was the final project for my Programming Languages class in WWU.

The gist of the project was to use Icon and another programming language that we are unfamiliar with to implement a word search program.
I chose Ruby, since I have never coded in Ruby before (nor in Icon).

The dictionary "dict" are all words in English dictionary with two characters or more, all lowercase.

The puzzles are made out of English alphabets in lowercase and is in rectangular shape.

Each row of the solutions are the word found in the puzzle, the point where it start, and the point where it ends.
