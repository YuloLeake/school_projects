Word search was the final project for my Programming Languages class in WWU.

The gist of the project was to use Icon and another programming language of our choice (I chose Ruby) to implement a word search program.

The dictioanry "dict" are all words in English dictionary with two characters or more, all lowercase.

The puzzles are made out of English alphabets in lowercase and is in rectanglar shape.

Each row of the solutions are the word found in the puzzle, the point where it start, and the point where it ends.
